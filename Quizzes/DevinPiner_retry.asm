	; Push all of the registers onto the stack because there are too many of them
	; to switch between during the procedure. With all of the register values on the
	; stack, we can use ESP to get the values without storing them in a register
	; Remember that the stack grows down, so we still add the number of bits
	; to get to the value we want

	PUSH EBX			;Array Length	ESP+8	VALUE
	PUSH ECX			;Lower bound	ESP+4	VALUE

	; Now we need to loop through the array from 0-arraylength
	; First, put the array length into ECX, which is at ESP+8. We need to generate
	; A value between the Lower bound and the upper bound. To do this, we find the 
	; distance between the two values and generate a number between 0 and the distance
	; then add the lower bound to the number. For example, with lower bound 25 and
	; upper bound 70, the distance between the bounds is 45. We generate a number
	; between 0 and 46 (not including 46) and add 25 (the lower bound) to push
	; the number into the correct range

	; Get the distance of the ranges (Upperbound-lowerbound). Put the (ESP) upper bound into
	; EAX, the lower bound (ESP+4) into EBX, then sub EBX from EAX and store the result 
	; in EAX. EAX now holds the distance between the bounds. We need to add 1 so that the
	; last value in the upper bound is included in the range. Push the distance onto the stack
	; and access it using ESP+16

	; use for the loop. Generate the number using Irvine RandomRange. Add the lower
